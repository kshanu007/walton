                    <p class="description">DefenseLite is a patented, retro-fit security shield mounted onto existing glazing creating unmatched forced entry protection. DefenseLite transforms windows and doors into impenetrable openings that are 250 times stronger than glass alone. DefenseLite is not an applied security film, but rather a heavy gauge architectural grade polycarbonate and extruded framing system designed to ‘keep the bad guys out’!<br>
                    Engineered using unbreakable UV coated polycarbonates and proprietary anchoring mechanisms, DefenseLite protects schools, storefronts and buildings of all types from unwanted entry. DefenseLite seamlessly blends into the existing glazing adding a constantly deployed, invisible layer of protection without moving parts or creating an undesirable fortress like visual.<br>

                    DefenseLite has been independently tested with many different blunt force objects ranging from batons, hammers and hatchets with amazing results.  DefenseLite is not a window film treatment at all and outperforms applied safety and ballistic film solutions exponentially.<br> 

                    While most security window films can delay entry for 30-45 seconds, DefenseLite is designed to stop vandals, smash and grab threats and forced entry attempts dead in their tracks. For retailers and storefronts, DefenseLite can protect your inventory against criminal trespass. For schools, educational institutions, and government facilities, DefenseLite can stop and deter intruders, protecting the people inside from harm.<br>

                    DefenseLite is also almost entirely invisible to the eye once installed, making it a transparent solution for retrofit door and window protection. Not only does DefenseLite outperform laminated glass and security window film treatments, but it’s also more affordable than unsightly grills and other conventional glass protection measures with less life-time warranty and service costs.
